            Summer holiday is actually the longest vacation I have had from work. If the summer time
            in Finland is rainy, then I usually dreaming about flying away to somewhere else.
            Really enjoy warmth and sun, summer evenings and swimming.

            Walking around the streets and visit little shops or go for a coffee somewhere, is also one of 
            my favorites. Feels like time has stopped and summer is endless. Usually one week is enough for me.
            But for having a perfect holiday, sometimes even long weekend somewhere else feels like magic.
